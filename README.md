# How to Access Windows 10 Remote Desktop on Azure VM with Public IP

Hey there! Welcome to this tutorial. Iâ€™ll walk you through the entire process of setting up and connecting to a **Remote Desktop (RDP)** session on an **Azure Virtual Machine** using its **Public IP address**. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to access your Azure VM from anywhere.

---

## Prerequisites

Before we jump in, hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:

- A **Microsoft Azure** account (if you donâ€™t have one, create it [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/))
- Basic knowledge of **Azure Virtual Machines**
- An **RDP client** on your computer (e.g., **Windows Remote Desktop** or **Microsoft Remote Desktop for macOS**)

---

## Operating Systems Used

- **Microsoft Windows 11** (version 21H2)

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Create a Resource Group

1. In the Azure portal, use the search bar to find **Resource Groups**.
2. Click on **+ Create** to start the process of creating your new resource group.

3. Give your resource group a name (for example, **MyResourceGroup**). 
4. Pick a region that works best for you. Youâ€™ll need to remember this when creating your virtual machine.
5. Click **Review + Create**, then hit **Create** when you're ready.

---

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

1. Once your resource group is created, search for **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal and click on **+ Create**.

   ![Public IP Address](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f54684c3-79b2-4c8d-9d6d-66dabe628d27)

2. Select the resource group you just created. This keeps everything organized!

   ![Select Resource Group](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41187d82-4c1c-4010-83f1-e928b2c2da68)

3. For the **VM Name**, you can name it the same as your resource group, but I recommend picking something a little different so itâ€™s easier to identify.

4. Choose the **Region** that matches your resource group to save on data transfer costs and improve performance.

5. For the **Image**, choose **Windows 10 Pro**.

6. Pick a **VM size** with at least **2 vCPUs** for optimal performance.
7. **Create a Username and Password**â€”these will be used to log in to your remote desktop.

- Don't forget to check the licensing box.
- Once youâ€™re done, click **Next** to go to the **Networking** tab.

### Step 3: Networking and IP Address

1. In the **Networking** section, make sure a **Public IP** is selected. This allows you to connect to your VM from anywhere.

2. Ensure that the **Network Security Group (NSG)** allows **RDP (Port 3389)** traffic. This is critical for remote connections.

   - If itâ€™s not set up, you can add a rule to allow inbound RDP traffic on **Port 3389**.

---

### Step 4: Review and Create the VM

1. After youâ€™ve configured everything, click **Review + Create** to review your settings.

2. Once youâ€™re happy with your settings, click **Create** to deploy your VM.

---

### Step 5: Connect to Your Virtual Machine Using RDP

1. Once your VM is deployed, head over to the **Overview** page in the Azure portal.
2. Copy the **Public IP address** of your VMâ€”youâ€™ll need it to connect remotely.

3. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your computer (just hit the Start menu, type 'Remote Desktop' in the search bar, and click on the app).

   ![Remote Desktop App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0ac2082-2a2d-490f-8a6e-410bab7391a4)

4. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste the **Public IP address** of your VM and click **Connect**.

   ![Connect to VM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6ccc33-faee-4244-be9f-d35509b6a881)

5. When prompted, enter the **username** and **password** you created during the VM setup. If you donâ€™t see the option, click **More Choices** and select **Different User**.

   ![Login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b01468b3-296b-424b-bf1d-c12a15bbb62b)

6. Finally, **click Yes** on the prompt that appears after pressing Enter to accept the connection.

## Congratulations

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve just set up your **Windows 10 Azure VM** and connected to it via **Remote Desktop** using the **Public IP address**. Now you can access and manage your VM from anywhere.
